# Task Manager API

## Description

This is a Task Manager API project that I built during the course I covered on Node in Udemy. 

## Goals for the Project

Improve upon the existing code in my own manner.

Avenues:

- FrontEnd:
        - Change Background Color
        - Change Interactivity
- Backend:
        - Add Avenue for Description to the Task (Additional Note)
        - Add Timer for the Events (Within said Date-Time-Period etc, if crossed particular time, then change task color of task to red)
        - Adaption to AWS(if possible)


## Release Versions

### Version 1.0.0
- Base Task Manager API made. 
- Functionality. Checkbox when task is done 


# USAGE

- To start using the application, download or fork the code into your local repository on your system.
- Ensure that Node and Node Package Manager are already installed on your system. If not, then go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and click the version applicable to you. 
- Once its done, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the repository and run the following command in your terminal 

                 npm start
- If the browser doesn't open automatically, then no worries! Navigate to the port where the server is listening (By default https:/localhost:3000) in the browser and open it up! You should be able to see it in all its glory :)
